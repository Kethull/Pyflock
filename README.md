# Pyflock
Python app to leverage OpenCV and MediaPipe to implement computer vision, and Pygame to visualize a flocking (boid) simulation.

Initial check in created entirely with generated code from Copilot, using descriptions generated from ChatGPT based one another flocking application written in Processing/Java.  Just out of interest sake.
